          <h1>Python Logbook</h1>
          <p>I created the Python Logbook as a way for me to keep track of my thoughts and
            accomplishments while coding. When I'm at my computer, opening a terminal is super quick
            and easy, and I wanted to be able to create a logbook entry as quickly as possible
            without even moving my hands from the keyboard. I made this possible by utilizing a python
            script that would create a series of folders for me to store my entry in, depending on the date,
            and then create a file that was named with the time. When I open up the terminal and type "newlog",
            a series of folders are automatically created in a set directory and the terminal asks me what my
            entry will be. I quickly type my entry and then enter to save. I can then exit the terminal and then
            continue on with my work.</p>

          <p> You're already here! I really like this website and am proud of the design
            that I created. I designed the site using Figma. This project also was the first time that
            I used Github. While creating this website I learned how to upload files to Github and use
            command-line git to manage my project. I learned how to use forks and how to push, pull, fetch
            and merge. I also learned how to use github pages to host my
            site.</p>
