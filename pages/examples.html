    <div class="project">
      <h1 class="example_title">Python Logbook</h1>
      <p>Started on 11/16/2019</p>
      <p>I created the Python Logbook as a way for me to keep track of my thoughts and accomplishments while coding. When I&#39;m at my computer, opening a terminal is super quick and easy, and I wanted to be able to create a logbook entry as quickly as possible without even moving my hands from the keyboard. I made this possible by utilizing a python script that would create a series of folders for me to store my entry in, depending on the date, and then create a file that was named with the time. When I open up the terminal and type &#34;newlog&#34;, a series of folders are automatically created in a set directory and the terminal asks me what my entry will be. I quickly type my entry and then enter to save. I can then exit the terminal and then continue on with my work.</p>

      <h1 class="example_title">My Website</h1>
      <p>Started on 9/12/2019</p>
      <p>You&#39;re already here! I really like this website and am proud of the design that I created. I designed the site using Figma. This project also was the first time that I used Github. While creating this website I learned how to upload files to Github and use command-line git to manage my project. I learned how to use forks and how to push, pull, fetch and merge. I also learned how to use github pages to host my site. Eventually, in December 2019, I started learning how to use Flask, a Python Microframework, to create a backend for my sites. This made my site much more useful and easier to maintain. The final product is what you see today!</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h1 class="example_title">ReCrypto</h1>
      <p>Started on 1/3/2020</p>
      <p>This was a website that I created as part of Hyland Hackathon 2020. The idea for the site was an application that would allow users to take a picture of their recyclables as they recycle them, and then reward them with a cryptocurrency. We were able to make a site that allowed users to create and log in to an account and upload pictures of them recycling. However, we didn&#39;t have enough time to create a verification and payment system.</p>
